//! The deterministic AAC content corpus — one signal per content class from
//! `docs/codec-aac-great-gate.md` §1.1.
//!
//! Every signal is generated from a formula or a seeded LCG: no binary fixtures,
//! no wall clock, no `rand`. Identical bytes on every machine and every run, which
//! is what makes a per-class ODG/NMR table comparable across sessions — and what
//! lets a gate's train/holdout split be *stable by name* (great-gate §4 rule 4).
//!
//! **The corpus law** (great-gate §2): a feature with a known physical premise
//! that the corpus cannot judge is a **corpus gap**, to be synthesized rather than
//! called done. Two classes here exist for exactly that reason and are marked
//! `gap: true`:
//!
//! * [`Class::QuietDynamic`] — arms A4 (absolute threshold of hearing) and A5
//!   (bit reservoir) have premises about *absolute level* and about level
//!   *varying over time*. A corpus of loudness-normalized music clips is
//!   structurally incapable of judging either.
//! * [`Class::MixedSpeechMusic`] — the audio analog of "variable scenes": the
//!   class that exposes every unfinished dispatch, because its character changes
//!   mid-stream.
//!
//! These are synthetic stand-ins, deliberately chosen to have the *physical*
//! property each arm keys on. They make the harness runnable and self-checking
//! offline; real recorded clips should join the corpus as first-class members
//! (great-gate §5) once available, and the per-class table is regenerated the
//! same way either side.
